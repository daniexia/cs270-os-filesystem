This document serves as a basic explanation of what we did in our file system, parameters of our file system and how to run.

1. What we did in this project

1) inode alloc/free/read/write
2) block alloc/free/read/write
3) file operations: mkdir/rmdir/mknod/unlink/read/write/truncate
4) direct, single indirect, double indirect blocks.
*5) truncate()
*6) cached free inode list on superblock.

2. what we need to present

1) persistent test: mount, unmount
2) file creation/deletion
3) big file creation/deletion
4) directory creation/deletion
5) nested directory creation/deletion
6) stat file info

3. key parameters

1) block size = 4KB = 4096
2) number of blocks = 1M = 1048576
3) file system size = 4GB
4) maximum length of file name = 252 characters
5) maximum entries in a directory = 100
6) maximum file size = 1GB
7) time to rebuild a filesystem (mkfs): 46 sec

4. steps to run
1) ./rebuild
This command resets all the storage and make the root file system. In case the file system is corrupted, this command is useful to rebuild a file system on the disk. Otherwise, you can just use the following command to open the storage.
2) ./monsterfs -f tmp
This command opens the storage and be ready for you to do operations on it. "-f" simply means running the file system in the foreground. "tmp" is our mount point.
